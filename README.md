# Introduction-Business-Problem
1) Introduction/Business Problem
The idea of this study is to help people planning to open a new restaurant in Toronto to chose the right location by providing data about the income and population of each neighborhood as well as the competitors already present on the same regions.

2) Downloading and Prepping Data
Toronto's Census data is publicly available at this website: https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#8c732154-5012-9afe-d0cd-ba3ffc813d5a

Toronto Neighborhoods' shapefile is publicly available at this website: https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#a45bd45a-ede8-730e-1abc-93105b2c439f


3) Methodology
For this report I used a few different maps that could help a new investor to decide the best neighborhood to open a restaurant in Toronto based on it's income, population and available competitors. In order to do that I've used the 2016 Census information combined with choropleth maps to visually display the wealthier and more populational neighborhoods and Foursquare data to display the current restaurants in each region.

4) Results
When I first decided to create this study I was expecting to find clusters of restaurants in certain regions and the final result didn't meet that expectation.
